= rdb-tool
Tool for manipulating Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories (SEL) relay database files (.rdb) files. Intended to allow automated processing and interoperability with protection relay files.

This is a work in progress. It seems to work moderately well for iterating across large folder structures and quantities of RDB files in a fairly short amount of time.

Feedback most welcome.

== Installation
